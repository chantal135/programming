<h2 id="a">WHY WEBSITE DESIGN MATTERS</h2>
<p id="b">Your website design is important because your customers care about design.Whether consciously or not, we all react to visuals and people are naturally drawn to good design. When it comes to your website design, studies have shown repeatedly that users quickly judge your business based on visuals alone, and will often stop using your site if it's poorly designed!</p>
